# Dollar Strength Analysis Project

## Project Goals and Roadmap

This document outlines the development goals for our dollar strength analysis system, including data integration, technical analysis capabilities, visualization improvements, and advanced features.

## Enhanced Data Analysis

1. **Incorporate more currency pairs**
   - Add major forex pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY DONE
   - Track dollar performance against individual currencies DONE
   - perform operation to see how it changes evry monyh over a period, like 6-9 months
   - Calculate weighted averages based on trading volumes

2. **Include commodity correlations**
   - Add gold, silver, copper and other commodities
   - Track inverse relationships between dollar and commodities
   - Calculate rolling correlations to identify changing relationships

3. **Add economic indicators**
   - Import data on interest rates across major economies
   - Track inflation numbers and differentials
   - Monitor employment figures and GDP growth
   - Analyze fundamental factors affecting dollar strength

4. **Compare to stock indices**
   - Add major indices like S&P 500, Nikkei, DAX
   - Understand risk sentiment relation to dollar movements
   - Identify flight-to-safety patterns during market stress

## Technical Analysis Features

1. **Moving averages**
   - Implement multiple timeframe moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200 days)
   - Add exponential moving averages
   - Calculate moving average crossovers as signals
   - Highlight trend strength and direction

2. **Relative strength indicators**
   - Implement RSI and other momentum oscillators
   - Add MACD for trend confirmation
   - Calculate Bollinger Bands for volatility measurement
   - Identify overbought/oversold conditions

3. **Volatility metrics**
   - Add CBOE's Dollar Volatility Index
   - Calculate rolling volatility over multiple timeframes
   - Implement ATR (Average True Range) indicators
   - Track volatility spikes as potential reversal signals

4. **Correlation matrix**
   - Show the changing correlations between the dollar and other assets
   - Create dynamic correlation charts over time
   - Identify regime changes in correlations
   - Generate alerts when traditional correlations break down

## Visualization Improvements

1. **Interactive charts**
   - Implement Plotly or Bokeh instead of Matplotlib
   - Create interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
   - Add tooltip information for better data exploration
   - Enable zooming and panning for detailed analysis

2. **Heatmaps**
   - Create correlation heatmaps between the dollar and various assets
   - Implement calendar heatmaps to show daily/weekly performance
   - Use color gradients to highlight strength relationships
   - Enable filtering and sorting of heatmap data

3. **Multi-timeframe view**
   - Allow toggling between different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Implement side-by-side comparison of different time periods
   - Add percentage change calculations across timeframes
   - Enable custom date range selection

## Advanced Features

1. **Sentiment analysis**
   - Scrape financial news headlines from major sources
   - Perform sentiment analysis on dollar-related news
   - Track sentiment shifts over time
   - Correlate news sentiment with price movements

2. **Central Bank policy tracker**
   - Track Fed vs other central bank policy decisions
   - Monitor interest rate expectations
   - Analyze central bank meeting minutes
   - Create countdown timers for upcoming policy decisions

3. **Machine learning predictions**
   - Use historical data to build prediction models
   - Implement feature engineering for better predictions
   - Create ensemble models combining technical and fundamental factors
   - Develop confidence intervals for predictions

4. **Automated reports**
   - Generate PDF reports with insights and visualization
   - Schedule daily/weekly/monthly report generation
   - Create executive summaries of dollar strength trends
   - Enable customizable report templates

5. **Economic calendar integration**
   - Pull in upcoming economic events that could impact the dollar
   - Highlight high-impact events
   - Track historical surprise factors in economic releases
   - Show event impacts on historical charts

6. **Interest rate differentials**
   - Track the spread between US rates and other major economies
   - Visualize yield curve changes over time
   - Calculate real interest rate differentials (accounting for inflation)
   - Correlate rate differentials with currency movements
